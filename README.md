### What is Productivity? 

<hr/>

Productivity is a native Desktop application that serves as a dashboard for productive widgets to increase effeciency in your workflow. Productivity is made from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Node.js.

Productivity uses the Electron.js Framework and runs on the Chromium / Node.js engine that Electron supplies. Productivity also allows for data persistence through the storage of your critical data in the App Data portion of your system (stored in JSON format).
